"""
Comprehensive DXF integration tests.
REFACTORED to eliminate Testing Theater anti-patterns:
- Removed DXFAnalyzer class that tested ezdxf's save/load.
- Tests now inspect the in-memory ezdxf.Drawing object directly.
- Assertions focus on whether styling logic correctly sets ezdxf entity/layer properties.
- Dependencies (StyleApplicatorService and its collaborators) are more realistically instantiated or mocked.

# Path(__file__).parent is a good approach for robustness.
