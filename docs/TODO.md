- [ ] Find duplication of code. Verify that current tools can do that by creating a fake scenario. nHow can we do this continously when i writes code not just when trying to comit?

- [ ] Veryify all vs code workspace settings. teher are deprectaed configuartions. compare with installed extensions and pyproject toml settings.
