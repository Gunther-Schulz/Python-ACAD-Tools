# This file makes the 'styling' directory a Python package.

# Optionally, expose key components for easier import:
# from .styling_utils import merge_style_components
# from .font_resolution_service import FontResolutionService
# ... etc. as other services are added.

# For now, keeping it simple until specific exports are needed.
