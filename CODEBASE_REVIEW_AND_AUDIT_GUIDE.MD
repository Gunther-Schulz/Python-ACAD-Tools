## Phase 0: Preparation & Objective Setting

### 0.1: Define Scope and Objectives
*   The AI **MUST** clearly define with the user what parts of the codebase are in scope (e.g., specific directories, modules, entire `src` folder).
*   The AI **MUST** confirm with the user the primary objectives of the review (e.g., identify code duplication, assess architectural adherence, find actionable TODOs, improve overall code quality, prepare for a major refactor).
*   The AI **SHOULD** ask the user if this is a one-time deep audit or if there's an expectation to establish a cadence for future, perhaps lighter-touch, reviews. If the latter, the AI **MUST** note this for potential inclusion in the final summary or recommendations.

### 0.2: Gather Key Project Documentation
*   The AI **MUST** identify and retrieve (e.g., using `read_file`) existing project documentation relevant to the review objectives. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD`
    *   `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD`
    *   Style guides (e.g., `CLIPPY.MD` or similar AI/developer guidelines)
    *   Requirements documents (if available and relevant)
    *   Existing issue logs or bug reports (if available and relevant)
    *   Previous review findings (if any, and accessible)
*   The AI **MUST** process these documents to understand established standards, architectural decisions, and known issues.

### 0.3: Establish Review Team & Roles (if applicable)
*   If the AI is the sole reviewer, this step **MUST** be noted as "AI operating as sole reviewer." The AI **MUST** clarify with the user any specific expectations for its role or reporting detail beyond this guide.
*   If the AI is part of a human-AI team, the AI **MUST** understand its specific role, responsibilities, and how it should interact with human team members (e.g., reporting formats, communication channels if specified by the user).

### 0.4: Set Up Tooling & Environment (AI Self-Check)
*   The AI **MUST** confirm it has access to the codebase via its available tools (e.g., `read_file`, `list_dir`, `file_search`, `grep_search`).
*   The AI **MUST** confirm it has loaded and understood any operational guidelines specified by the user (e.g., `CLIPPY.MD`) and will adhere to them throughout the review process.

---

## Phase 1: Initial High-Level Overview (Optional First Pass)

### 1.1: Understand Overall Project Structure
*   The AI **SHOULD** use tools like `list_dir` to understand the directory layout of the in-scope codebase.
*   The AI **SHOULD** attempt to identify major components, modules, and their apparent responsibilities based on naming conventions and directory structure, cross-referencing with `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD` if available.

### 1.2: Identify Potential Hotspots & Areas of Concern
*   Based on the initial structural overview (1.1) and information from project documentation (`PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD`, `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD`, previous findings), the AI **SHOULD** note areas that might warrant closer inspection. These could be modules that appear overly complex (e.g., many files, deeply nested), seem to violate architectural principles, or are flagged in documentation as problematic.
*   The AI **MAY** perform high-level semantic searches (e.g., using `grep_search` with broad patterns or `codebase_search` if available) for common anti-patterns (e.g., large conditional blocks, overly long functions) or keywords related to the review objectives.

### 1.3: Preliminary Finding Notation
*   The AI **MUST** log any initial observations or potential issues identified during this phase.
*   **Crucial Caveat:** The AI **MUST** clearly mark these findings as **PRELIMINARY AND REQUIRING DEEPER VALIDATION** with sufficient context in Phase 2. The AI **MUST NOT** draw firm conclusions or make definitive assessments at this stage.

---

## Phase 2: Detailed, Iterative Review & Analysis (Core Phase)

### 3.1: Guiding Principle: Fact-Based Analysis & Sufficient Context
*   **Immutable Condition:** All significant findings, assessments, and conclusions generated by the AI **MUST** be based on direct code examination (using tools like `read_file`) and sufficient, verified context from the codebase or authoritative project documentation.
*   The AI **MUST NOT** make decisions or firm assessments based on incomplete information or unverified assumptions.

### 3.2: Systematic Review Methodology
*   The AI **MUST** iterate through the defined scope (e.g., file-by-file, module-by-module within target directories like `src/`).
*   For each unit of review (e.g., a Python file):
    1.  **Context Gathering (Mandatory & Iterative):**
        *   The AI **MUST** obtain an initial view of the file/module content (e.g., using `read_file`).
        *   **Due Diligence Condition:** If the initial context is insufficient for the AI to make a clear, fact-based assessment regarding a potential issue (aligned with Phase 3.3 objectives), the AI **MUST HALT** the assessment of that specific point.
        *   **AI Action for Insufficient Context:** The AI **MUST** proactively seek more information. This includes, but is not limited to:
            *   Requesting full file reads of the current file (if only a partial view was obtained).
            *   Reading adjacent or related files/modules (identified by imports or logical connection).
            *   Using codebase search tools (`grep_search` for specific patterns, `codebase_search` for symbol usages if available) for related components, usages, or definitions.
            *   Consulting project documentation (previously gathered in Phase 0.2) for clarifications related to the code under review.
            *   If ambiguity persists after exhausting available tools and documentation, the AI **MUST** note the ambiguity, the attempts made to resolve it, and **HALT** further analysis on that specific point, flagging it for user consultation (see Phase 6.2).
        *   The AI **MUST ONLY** proceed with an assessment for a specific point once sufficient, verified context is obtained or the path for user consultation is determined.
    2.  **Analysis:**
        *   The AI **MUST** examine the code for issues aligned with the review objectives (see Section 3.3), using the verified context.
        *   The AI **MUST** strive to understand the logic, data flow, and interactions within the unit and with other components.
    3.  **Initial Finding Logging (Internal):** The AI **SHOULD** internally note potential issues with specific line numbers, code snippets, and preliminary thoughts. These are subject to further verification and refinement before being documented in Phase 3.

### 3.3: Key Areas of Investigation
*(The AI **MUST** tailor its investigation based on review objectives confirmed with the user. This list is a comprehensive starting point.)*
*   **Code Duplication:** True functional/logic duplication vs. necessary boilerplate or appropriate delegation. The AI **MUST** use tools like `grep_search` or semantic diffing (if available) to identify similar code blocks and then analyze their context.
*   **Architectural Adherence:** Compliance with `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD`. Correct use of defined patterns (Adapter, DI, Factory, etc.). Clear boundaries and responsibilities. The AI **MUST** compare observed patterns with documented ones.
*   **Project Standards:** Adherence to `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD`, coding style, naming conventions. The AI **SHOULD** flag deviations.
*   **Actionable Items:** TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, incomplete implementations. The AI **MUST** log these meticulously using `grep_search` for common patterns.
*   **Pydantic V2 Compliance (if applicable and in scope):** Correct usage of `BaseModel`, `BaseSettings`, `Field`, validators, `model_config`, etc. The AI **SHOULD** check for common misconfigurations or deprecated V1 patterns if migrating.
*   **Error Handling:** Robustness, clarity, use of custom exceptions vs. generic ones. The AI **SHOULD** assess if error handling is consistent and informative.
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity if measurable), clarity of comments, organization, function/method length. The AI **SHOULD** note areas that are difficult to understand.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities (if in scope):** Use of `eval()`, unsanitized inputs, hardcoded secrets, etc. The AI **MUST** use `grep_search` for known vulnerable patterns and report findings cautiously for user review.
*   **Performance Issues (if in scope):** Obvious inefficient algorithms, redundant operations in loops, excessive I/O. The AI **SHOULD** highlight potential bottlenecks for deeper investigation.
*   **Test Coverage Gaps (if assessing tests or testability is a concern):** Missing tests for critical logic, untestable code structures. The AI **SHOULD** note areas where testability could be improved.
*   **Test Quality & Precision (NEW - Critical for Bug Detection):** Evaluate existing tests for quality and precision using the criteria in Section 3.6. The AI **MUST** identify potential test-masked bugs, overly broad mocking, missing negative assertions, and tests based on assumptions rather than actual implementation analysis.

### 3.4: Differentiating Duplication, Delegation, and Abstraction
*   The AI **MUST** critically assess similarities in code:
    *   **True Duplication:** Independent re-implementation of the same non-trivial logic. This **MUST** be flagged.
    *   **Appropriate Delegation:** Correctly calling another component responsible for the logic. This is generally good practice and **SHOULD NOT** be flagged as duplication.
    *   **Shared Abstraction/Utility:** Intentional reuse of common, well-defined helper functions, classes, or patterns from a shared module. This is good practice and **SHOULD NOT** be flagged as duplication.
*   The AI **MUST** use context (imports, class hierarchies, module purpose) to make these differentiations.

### 3.5: Due Diligence Condition: Verification of Assumptions
*   **Immutable Condition:** Before any finding is finalized for reporting in Phase 3, or any recommendation is made based on it, any underlying assumptions the AI made during its analysis **MUST** be explicitly stated and then verified against facts from the codebase or authoritative documentation (using tools like `read_file`, `grep_search`).
*   If an assumption cannot be verified by the AI through available tools and documentation, the finding **MUST** be caveated, or the AI **MUST HALT** and flag the point for user consultation to obtain verification or clarification.
*   The final set of reported issues, especially those leading to a refactoring plan, **MUST** be demonstrably fact-based, with assumptions minimized and verified.

### 3.6: Test Quality Assessment & Test-Masked Bug Detection (NEW)
*   **Purpose:** During codebase review, the AI **MUST** evaluate existing tests not just for coverage but for quality and precision to identify potential test-masked bugs.
*   **Test Quality Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   **Mocking Precision:** Are tests mocking only external dependencies and immediate collaborators, or are they mocking the methods being tested? Overly broad mocking can mask bugs by preventing problematic code paths from executing.
    *   **Behavioral Completeness:** Do tests verify both positive behaviors (what should happen) and negative behaviors (what should NOT happen)? Missing negative assertions can allow inappropriate method calls to go undetected.
    *   **Context Alignment:** Are tests based on actual implementation analysis or assumptions about how code should work? Tests based on assumptions may not catch real implementation bugs.
    *   **Integration Boundary Coverage:** For adapter patterns, do tests verify both interface compliance AND proper usage patterns? Tests that only mock adapters may miss inappropriate direct calls that bypass abstractions.
*   **Test-Masked Bug Indicators:**
    *   Tests that pass but allow known problematic code paths to execute without detection.
    *   Tests with overly broad mocks that prevent the actual service logic from being exercised.
    *   Tests that verify method calls were made but not whether they were appropriate or correctly sequenced.
    *   Missing negative assertions that would catch architectural violations (e.g., direct ezdxf calls when adapter should be used).
*   **AI Action for Test Quality Issues:** When poor test quality is identified, the AI **MUST**:
    *   Document the test quality issue in `OTHER_CODE_QUALITY_OBSERVATIONS.MD` with specific examples.
    *   Include test refinement tasks in the refactoring plan with emphasis on precision and bug detection capability.
    *   Flag areas where test-masked bugs are likely to exist for deeper investigation during refactoring.

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Documentation of Findings

### 4.1: Principle: Clear, Actionable, and Referenced Findings
*   Each finding documented by the AI **MUST** be detailed enough for another developer or AI to understand the issue, its location(s), and its potential impact without needing to re-derive the context entirely.

### 4.2: Recommended Report Structure
*   The AI **MUST** maintain separate, structured Markdown files for different categories of findings. The recommended files are:
    *   `DUPLICATION_FINDINGS.MD`
    *   `ACTIONABLE_ITEMS.MD` (for TODOs, placeholders, etc.)
    *   `ARCHITECTURAL_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD`
    *   `OTHER_CODE_QUALITY_OBSERVATIONS.MD` (for issues not fitting elsewhere)
*   Each report **MUST** include:
    *   Document Purpose, Review Date, and Scope (as defined in Phase 0.1).
    *   An Executive Summary (optional, but recommended for larger reviews, to be generated by the AI).
    *   Detailed findings, categorized appropriately within the report.
*   For each individual finding, the AI **MUST** include:
    *   A unique ID/Title for easy reference.
    *   Location(s): File path(s) and specific line numbers or code blocks.
    *   Detailed analysis of the issue, with specific code examples where helpful to illustrate the point. This analysis **MUST** be based on the verified context from Phase 2.
    *   Impact assessment (e.g., functional, maintainability, performance, security).
    *   Severity classification (see 4.3).
    *   Recommended resolution or action (e.g., "Refactor to use shared utility X," "Update code to align with `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD` Section Y," "Complete placeholder implementation for Z").

### 4.3: Severity Classification (Example)
*   The AI **MUST** use a consistent severity classification. The following is an example; the user may provide a project-specific scheme:
    *   🔴 **CRITICAL:** Issue causes functional errors, security vulnerabilities, or significant architectural breakdown. Requires immediate attention.
    *   🟡 **MODERATE:** Issue increases maintenance burden, introduces inconsistencies, or represents a notable deviation from standards/architecture. Should be addressed.
    *   🟢 **MINOR:** Issue is a small pattern duplication, minor style inconsistency, or an opportunity for slight improvement with low functional impact.
    *   🔵 **INFO/PLACEHOLDER:** Actionable comments like TODOs, FIXMEs, or documented placeholders requiring implementation or review.
*   The AI **MUST** apply this classification based on its analysis of impact and alignment with project goals.

### 4.4: Recommendations for Each Finding
*   The AI **MUST** suggest whether the code needs updates, documentation needs updates, or both for each finding.
*   If a clear resolution path is identifiable based on project standards or architectural documents, the AI **SHOULD** propose a specific approach.

---

## Phase 4: Cross-Referencing with Architectural & Project Standards

### 5.1: Validate Against `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD`
*   The AI **MUST** systematically compare documented architectural patterns, component responsibilities, and interaction diagrams (as described in `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD`, obtained in Phase 0.2) against the actual implementation observed in the codebase during Phase 2.
*   The AI **MUST** log all identified discrepancies in `ARCHITECTURAL_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD` (as per Phase 3.2 structure).

### 5.2: Validate Against `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD`
*   The AI **MUST** check the codebase for adherence to coding standards, naming conventions, Pydantic usage mandates, DI principles, etc., as defined in `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD` (obtained in Phase 0.2).
*   The AI **SHOULD** note significant or systemic deviations in `OTHER_CODE_QUALITY_OBSERVATIONS.MD` or a dedicated section if deviations are numerous and warrant it, unless they are direct architectural deviations (which go to `ARCHITECTURAL_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD`). Minor, isolated style issues might be noted with lower severity.

### 5.3: Identify and Document Deviations
*   For each deviation logged (either architectural or standard-related), the AI **MUST** analyze and suggest, based on the context and project documentation:
    *   If the code is incorrect and needs to be refactored to align with the documentation.
    *   If the documentation (`PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD` or `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD`) appears outdated or incorrect and potentially needs to be updated by the user to reflect a deliberate and sound implementation choice observed in the code.
    *   If both code and documentation might require adjustment.
*   The AI **MUST** clearly state its reasoning for these suggestions in the respective finding reports.

---

## Phase 5: Developing a Refactoring & Remediation Plan

### 6.1: Prioritize Findings
*   The AI **MUST** rank all documented findings (from Phase 3 reports) based on their severity, potential impact, inter-dependencies, and alignment with the project's primary architectural goals (as understood from `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD` and user objectives from Phase 0.1).
*   The AI **SHOULD** generally propose addressing foundational architectural issues before more localized problems, as these often simplify subsequent fixes. If this general approach seems inappropriate for specific critical issues, the AI **MUST** note this and seek user guidance on prioritization.
*   The AI **MUST** present this proposed prioritization to the user for review and confirmation before finalizing the refactoring plan.

### 6.2: Develop a Phased Approach
*   Based on the user-confirmed prioritization, the AI **MUST** group related fixes into logical, sequential phases (e.g., Phase 1: Core Architectural Alignment, Phase 2: Domain Model Integrity, Phase 3: Service Layer Refinement, etc.).
*   The AI **MUST** define clear, achievable objectives and specific tasks for each phase, referencing the unique IDs of the findings being addressed. **For each task that involves code modification, the AI MUST explicitly include sub-items or notes within the task definition regarding the creation or update of unit and integration tests, and critically, for the AI to *execute these tests and confirm they pass* before considering the task or sub-task complete, as per the 'Comprehensive Testing' guiding principle (Section 6.3 of this guide and the refactoring plan itself).**
*   **Establish Guiding Principles for the Plan (NEW):** The generated refactoring plan (e.g., `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`) **MUST** include a dedicated section outlining "Guiding Principles & General Practices". This section **MUST** incorporate, at a minimum, AI-executable instructions for:
    *   The phased approach itself.
    *   Systematic issue tracking referencing the audit reports.
    *   Adherence to AI operational guidelines (like `CLIPPY.MD`).
    *   Comprehensive Testing (as detailed in Section 6.3 of this guide, including test execution).
    *   The "No Backward Compatibility Layers" principle.
    *   Continuous Documentation Alignment (AI Action).
    *   Atomic Commits & Plan Referencing (AI Action).
    *   A mechanism for Status Tracking of plan items (e.g., marking items as `[SOLVED - YYYY-MM-DD]`, `[IN PROGRESS - YYYY-MM-DD]`, etc., for both AI and user actions) (NEW).
*   **Adherence to No Backward Compatibility:** The AI **MUST** ensure the plan aims for direct implementation of the target architecture without introducing temporary backward compatibility layers, aligning with project principles for early-stage development (and the "No Backward Compatibility" principle mentioned above).
*   The AI **MUST** document this complete, phased refactoring plan in a dedicated file (e.g., `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`).

### 6.3: Integrate Comprehensive Testing
*   **Immutable Condition for the AI when generating the Refactoring Plan:** The plan **MUST** stipulate that for every refactoring task involving code changes:
    *   Existing tests covering the functionality **MUST** be identified, updated, and verified to pass by the AI executing the plan.
    *   New unit and/or integration tests **MUST** be written by the AI executing the plan to cover new or significantly modified logic and interactions.
    *   The refactoring plan **MUST** advocate for the AI executing the plan to **run tests regularly throughout the process (e.g., after each significant change or sub-task completion) and confirm they pass before proceeding. If tests fail, the AI MUST address the failures (either in the tests or the code) before considering the current step complete.**
    *   The goal stated in the plan **MUST** be to verify correctness, prevent regressions, and maintain/improve overall test coverage (e.g., aiming for at least 80% or as defined by project standards).
    *   The plan **SHOULD** recommend that tests are ideally written before or alongside code changes (Test-Driven Development or Behavior-Driven Development principles, if aligned with project standards).
*   **Test Quality & Precision Requirements (NEW - Critical for Bug Detection):** The plan **MUST** include specific guidance for test quality to prevent test-masked bugs:
    *   **Minimal Dependency Mocking:** Tests should mock only external dependencies (databases, file systems, network calls) and immediate collaborators. Avoid mocking the methods being tested or their direct internal logic.
    *   **Behavioral Verification:** Tests should verify both positive behaviors (what should happen) and negative behaviors (what should NOT happen). Use assertions like `assert_not_called()` or `call_count == 0` to verify inappropriate methods aren't invoked.
    *   **Context-Driven Test Development:** Tests **MUST** be based on actual codebase analysis rather than assumptions about how code should work. The AI **MUST** examine the actual implementation before writing tests.
    *   **Test-Masked Bug Detection:** If a test passes but later analysis reveals a bug in the actual code, this indicates insufficient test precision. The bug **MUST** be fixed and the test **MUST** be refined to catch such issues in the future.
    *   **Integration Boundary Testing:** For adapter patterns, test both the adapter interface compliance AND the service's proper usage of that interface, ensuring inappropriate direct calls don't bypass the abstraction.
*   The AI **MUST** explicitly incorporate this testing mandate (including execution, pass confirmation, and quality requirements) into the "Guiding Principles & General Practices" section of the generated `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`.

### 6.4: Estimate Effort & Resources (Optional, AI-Adapted)
*   If requested by the user, the AI **MAY** attempt to provide a qualitative assessment of complexity for each phase or major task in the refactoring plan (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High" complexity based on factors like number of files affected, depth of changes, interdependencies).
*   The AI **SHOULD NOT** attempt to estimate human-centric effort (e.g., person-days) unless specifically calibrated and guided by the user with a defined model for such estimations.
*   Any complexity assessment provided by the AI **MUST** be clearly marked as an estimate based on its current understanding and may require user validation.

### 6.5: Handling Emergent Issues During Refactoring (NEW)
*   **Principle:** Refactoring is a discovery process. New issues, or a deeper understanding of previously logged issues, may emerge as the AI works through the codebase according to an existing `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`. Adherence to a strict protocol for managing these discoveries is crucial to maintain clarity, user oversight, and plan integrity.
*   **Definition of a 'Significant Issue/Deviation' for this Protocol:** For the purposes of this protocol, a 'significant issue' or 'deviation' is not limited to newly discovered bugs or major architectural flaws. It **also explicitly includes necessary scope adjustments, new feature requirements, or abstraction gaps (e.g., missing methods in an interface/adapter that are prerequisites for the current task but were not in its original plan) identified during a sub-task that were not part of its original defined scope and which require distinct planning, effort, or re-prioritization.** If such an item is identified, the AI MUST trigger the full protocol below.
*   **Bug Discovery Categories & Immediate Actions (NEW):** When bugs are discovered during refactoring, the AI **MUST** categorize them and take appropriate immediate action:
    *   **Critical Bugs (Syntax/Import/Execution Blocking):** **MUST** be fixed immediately as part of the current refactoring work to maintain a functional codebase. Document the fix and continue.
    *   **Logic Bugs Revealed by Testing:** When tests reveal bugs in the actual codebase (not just test code), these bugs **MUST** be fixed before the tests can be considered complete. This is a sign that the code has latent issues that proper testing has uncovered.
    *   **Test-Masked Bugs:** If a test passes but later analysis reveals a bug in the actual service code, this indicates the test was too broadly mocked or insufficiently precise. Both the bug **MUST** be fixed AND the test **MUST** be refined to catch such issues in the future.
    *   **Non-Critical Logic Bugs:** Should be documented in the appropriate report (`OTHER_CODE_QUALITY_OBSERVATIONS.MD` for general issues, `ARCHITECTURE_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD` for architectural concerns) and added to the refactoring plan for systematic resolution.
*   **AI Action upon Discovering a New Significant Issue/Deviation:**
    1.  **PAUSE Current Refactoring Sub-Task:** The AI **MUST** immediately and strictly pause the specific refactoring sub-task during which the new issue was identified. The AI **MUST NOT** proceed with further steps for the *current paused sub-task* or attempt to fix/plan for the *newly discovered issue* until the following protocol for the emergent issue is completed.
    2.  **Document the New Issue Thoroughly:** The AI **MUST** fully document the new issue with the same rigor as initial findings (see Phase 3: Comprehensive Documentation of Findings). This includes:
        *   Location(s), detailed analysis, impact assessment, and severity.
        *   If the issue is an architectural deviation, it **MUST** be logged in `ARCHITECTURE_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD`.
        *   If it's another type of code quality issue, it **MUST** be logged in the appropriate findings document (e.g., `DUPLICATION_FINDINGS.MD`, `OTHER_CODE_QUALITY_OBSERVATIONS.MD`).
    3.  **Notify User & Propose Integration Strategy for the New Issue:** The AI **MUST** notify the user about the newly discovered and documented issue.
    4.  **Propose Plan Adjustment for the New Issue:** Concurrently with the notification, the AI **MUST** propose to the user how this new finding should be integrated into the existing `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD`. This proposal **MUST** focus *only on the placement and prioritization of the new issue* within the overall plan, not on its immediate solution. Options might include:
        *   Adding it as a new item to an existing phase.
        *   Creating a new phase if the issue is substantial or foundational.
        *   Adjusting the priority of existing tasks if the new issue impacts them.
    5.  **Await User Guidance on Plan Adjustment:** The AI **MUST** await explicit user confirmation on how to proceed with integrating the new issue into the refactoring plan. The AI **MUST NOT** unilaterally update the plan or start working on the new issue.
    6.  **Update Plan (Only After User Guidance):** Once the user provides guidance on integrating the new issue, the AI **MUST** update the `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` accordingly.
    7.  **Determine Next Action (Resuming Paused Task or Addressing New Task):** Only after the `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` is updated, the AI, in consultation with the user if the path forward isn't obvious (e.g., if the new issue is now the highest priority), will determine whether to:
        *   Resume the originally paused sub-task (if it's still relevant and appropriately prioritized).
        *   Begin a new sub-task to address the newly integrated emergent issue (if it has become the priority).
*   **Rationale:** Ensures that the refactoring process remains flexible, responsive to new information, and that all significant issues are systematically tracked and planned for, maintaining user oversight. This strict pause-document-report-plan_integration-await_guidance sequence prevents premature or out-of-process work on emergent issues. Minor, trivial discoveries that can be fixed within the immediate scope of an ongoing task without altering the plan's intent *and without significant deviation from the current task's focus* may not require this full pause-and-report cycle, but the AI **MUST** use its judgment with extreme caution and **ALWAYS** err on the side of reporting if unsure or if the discovery feels like a separate concern. Eagerness to fix is a failure mode to be actively avoided.

---

## Phase 6: Final Reporting & Integration of Learnings (AI Actions)

### 7.1: Consolidate and Verify All Documentation
*   The AI **MUST** ensure all finding reports (`DUPLICATION_FINDINGS.MD`, `ACTIONABLE_ITEMS.MD`, etc.), the `ARCHITECTURAL_DEVIATIONS_REPORT.MD`, and the `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` are complete, internally consistent, and cross-referenced appropriately (e.g., refactoring plan items referencing finding IDs).
*   The AI **MUST** create or update a main summary document or a clear entry point in the conversation history (e.g., a final message with links) to all generated artifacts, ensuring easy navigation for the user.
*   The AI **MUST** verify that all generated Markdown documentation adheres to project formatting standards if specified, or general best practices for readability.

### 7.2: Prepare Comprehensive Summary for User Review
*   The AI **MUST** generate a concise, high-level summary encompassing:
    *   The key findings from all audit reports.
    *   The most significant architectural deviations identified.
    *   The full proposed `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` (or a direct link to it if very long, with its executive summary included here).
*   This summary **MUST** highlight critical issues, their potential impact, and the strategic order of the refactoring plan, emphasizing the rationale for this order.
*   The AI **MUST** present this summary and clear links to all detailed reports and the refactoring plan to the user for final review, discussion, and explicit approval before the AI proceeds to execute any part of the refactoring plan.

### 7.3: Incorporate Learnings into Operational Guidelines (AI Self-Improvement)
*   After user validation of findings and potentially after stages of the refactoring plan are executed, the AI **MUST** review systemic issues, common anti-patterns identified during the audit, or novel best practices established.
*   If these learnings represent general improvements to code quality assessment, review efficiency, or adherence to architectural principles, the AI **SHOULD** (if appropriate mechanisms exist, such as updatable persona/guideline documents like `CLIPPY.MD`, or with explicit user direction) consider how these learnings could be proposed for integration into its own operational guidelines or future review checklists.
*   The AI **MUST** log any significant patterns of error it frequently encounters in the reviewed codebase (or causes during its own operations if `CLIPPY.MD` is active) to aid in its future self-correction and adherence to project standards. This log should be for AI's internal improvement or for discussion with the user on common project pitfalls.

## Appendix A: Checklist for Due Diligence Conditions

*(The AI **MUST** be able to confirm YES to all applicable conditions before considering the audit phase complete and the refactoring plan ready for user approval)*

*   [ ] **Objective Definition:** Has the AI confirmed the scope and objectives of the review with the user (Phase 0.1)?
*   [ ] **Sufficient Context Protocol:**
    *   [ ] For every significant assessment made, did the AI obtain sufficient context from the codebase (Phase 3.2.1)?
    *   [ ] Did the AI follow the protocol for seeking more context (e.g., requesting full files, using search tools) when initial views were inadequate (Phase 3.2.1)?
    *   [ ] Are all major conclusions in the finding reports based on direct examination of relevant code sections and verified information (Phase 3.1)?
*   [ ] **Fact-Based Analysis:**
    *   [ ] Are all significant findings in reports demonstrably based on facts observed in the code or authoritative documentation (Phase 3.1, 3.5)?
    *   [ ] Have assumptions made by the AI during analysis been explicitly stated and subsequently verified against facts or flagged for user consultation if unverified (Phase 3.5)?
*   [ ] **Architectural Cross-Reference:** Has the AI compared findings against `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.MD` and clearly noted deviations (Phase 5.1)?
*   [ ] **Standards Cross-Reference:** Has the AI compared findings against `PROJECT_STANDARDS.MD` (Phase 5.2)?
*   [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation:** Has the AI systematically documented all categories of findings (duplication, TODOs, architectural deviations, other quality issues) in their respective structured reports (Phase 3.2)?
*   [ ] **Actionable Recommendations:** Does each significant finding in the reports have a clear, actionable recommendation from the AI (Phase 4.4)?
*   [ ] **Integrated Testing in Plan:** Does the generated `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` explicitly incorporate the AI-executable requirement for comprehensive testing (including writing, updating, **and regularly executing tests, confirming they pass**) alongside refactoring tasks, as per Section 6.3 (Phase 6.2, 6.3)?
*   [ ] **Test Quality Assessment:** Has the AI evaluated existing tests for quality and precision using Section 3.6 criteria, identifying potential test-masked bugs and documenting test quality issues?
*   [ ] **Refactoring Plan Guiding Principles:** Does the generated `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` include the mandatory "Guiding Principles & General Practices" section with all required AI-executable points (Phase 6.2)?
*   [ ] **Final Plan Grounding:** Is the final `REFACTORING_PLAN.MD` built upon findings that have met the "sufficient context" and "fact-based analysis" criteria (Implicit throughout, checked here)?
*   [ ] **User Review of Prioritization:** Has the AI presented its proposed prioritization of findings to the user for review and confirmation before finalizing the refactoring plan (Phase 6.1)?
